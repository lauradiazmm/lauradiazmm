### Hi there, welcome to my GitHub profile

👨🏽‍💻 I'm Laura Díaz and I'm currently diving deep into the 📈 **Data Analytics** and **Data Science** world. 

🗂 Here you can find the **main projects** I have worked with Python, and a description of them:
* 🧠 [Prediction Models for Alzheimer's Detection](https://github.com/lauradiazmm/Alzheimer-s-Project): This project develops a robust Alzheimer's prediction model using machine learning (Random Forest, XGBoost) and deep learning (CNN) on clinical data and neuroimages.
* 💰 [Customer Churn Predictor](In process): Supervised & Deep Learning Models for customer churn prediction, able to detect 90% of the churned customers on the test model
* 🚬 [Binary Prediction of Smoker Status](https://github.com/lauradiazmm/Binary-prediction-of-smoking-status): Use of binary classification to predict a patient's smoking status given information about various other health indicators
